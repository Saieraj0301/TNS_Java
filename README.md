## Introduction

This repository contains the Java assignments I've completed during the **TNS India Foundation Training Program**. Each assignment is designed to deepen my understanding of Java programming concepts, from basic syntax to advanced topics.

## Course Overview

The program is structured into several modules, each focusing on different aspects of Java programming:

1. **Introduction to Java**: Basic syntax, variables, data types, and operators.
2. **Control Structures**: Conditional statements, loops, and exception handling.
3. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
4. **Java Collections Framework**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and collections framework.
5. **Advanced Topics**: Multithreading, file I/O, and network programming.
